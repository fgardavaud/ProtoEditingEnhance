# Hello and welcome,

## CT system requirement
This code has been tested in GE CT platform such as CT750HD and Revo HD GSI. 
Old VCT platform could be ok as the structure of system files 

**This code won't work on new Revolution CT or Revolution Frontier platform** as the structure of the system file to design the CT protocols have changed

## Set up your CT environment
If you want to contribute to this project, I recommend you to first extract your profile system files (.proto file) by doing a *full save state* operation.
Then I highlly recommend you to save those files in a safe place.

## Code langage & OS platform

This code have been developped in bash/shell langage and adapted on macOS platform.
The code have been exhaustively commented, as you can understand the function of every code block. If not you can e-mail me. I will try to support you.
**You will have to adapt some command**, such as to sed, to another OS platform such as Windows or Linux.

Now you can be an sorcerer's apprentice.
Keep in mind you are operating on an health machine so be ethics !

Have a nice contribution.
